# Time to be Hapi - london.js talk

This repo contains material created for a talk
given at [london.js](http://www.meetup.com/London-JavaScript-Community/events/228773686/) on Tuesday, March 15, 2016 called "Time to be Hapi".


## Downloading
You first need to install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) if you do not already have it on your computer. Then download the code from github:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/glennjones/time-to-be-hapi.git
```
or
```
    $ curl -L https://github.com/glennjones/time-to-be-hapi/tarball/master | tar zx
```

## Slides
The slides are built in html and the file `slides/index.html` can be dragged into a browser.


## Running the code example
I have built code examples for most of the sections of the presentation.


1. Move into the project directory `$ cd time-to-be-hapi`
2. Run `$ npm i`
2. Move to one of the code example directories i.e. `$ cd code-example\02 adding routes`
4. Run `$ node app`
5. Connect to the server in a browser using `http://localhost:3000` or read the comments at the top of each app.js file for web addresses to view.

Move through each code example directory re-running stages 3-4
